# liveview-reactflow-example

Quick demo on how one can use React libraries with Liveview by having a Reactflow example.

This is still under development / exploration on what can be done to interact with React and the main code is on [`assets/js/nodes.jsx`](assets/js/nodes.jsx) and [`lib/react_node_demo_web/page_live.ex`](lib/react_node_demo_web/page_live.ex)

See the video at [demo.mp4](demo.mp4)

Have fun!
